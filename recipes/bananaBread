#banana bread

*6/3oz flour
*6/3oz butter
*6/3oz sugar
*2 bananas
*3/2 eggs
*2 table spoons of cinnamon
*2 tea spoons vanila extract

;note this recipe can be made in a full or half size, if doing half then use smaller bananas or just one big one
;1) grease and line a baking tin, this can be a cake tin or a loaf tin, whatever you have, i personally use a loaf tin though
;2) cream the butter and sugar together with an electric mixer or wisk
;3) crack all the eggs into the bowl of creamed sugar and butter, and mix
;4) in a separate bowl, cut and crush the bananas into an almost paste
;5) add the bananas to the rest of the sugar butter and egg mix, and mix again
;6) add all the flower and cinnamon to the mix and mix in
;7) finally add the vanila extract to this mix and mit it too

;optional: if you want it can be nice to add wallnuts to this or chocolate chips so if you want to do that, do it now

;8) pour the mixture into you lined tin and place in the oven at gas 4 (180C)
;9) take out after about half an hour, poke a knife through the middle of it, if when removed it is clean then its cooked, if not cook for 10 more mins and try again
:10) remove from the tray and leave to cool for at least 20 mins


;optional: on top it can be nice to add dried banana chunks or crushed nuts so add these if you wish

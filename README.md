# recipe-website
a tool which lets you right recipes in simple syntax for it to be converted to html

the idea is simple, why should there be ads when you want to cook some food

i wanted to make this javascript free, not even a touch of it is here

it has simple workings using c to genterate html from a simple syntax system

the syntax is as follows

```#```
putting this at the start of the line will set a title, dont use this more than once

```*```
putting this at the start of the line will set an ingredient

```;``` 
putting this will set a step for making

# contributing
this has been kept simple too

just send a pull request into this repo with your recipe in the recipes folder

the more you send in the better this will be for everyone

# actually seeing the site
this site (for now) is something that you should run localy

you can have it on a specific device and you just get your browser to open index.html

or if you feel a bit more fancy you can host this on a raspbery pi and use it on your home network

and if your really fancy you could use the same steps but on a vps and give it a spot on the web
